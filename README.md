# Digitized_Parkinson_Disease_Detection
This is a project to Detect Parkinson disease using digitized spiral images on ML and Deep Learning platform using TensorFlow, Keras, Streamlit, OpenCV . The models used are Random Forest, Knn, Logistic Regression and CNN-2D.
Importances are regular visit to doctor is necessary but not possible.Some innovation reuired in diagnosis.
Brain MRI are expensive and uncomfortable.
Easily accessible with one digitized tab where spiral drawings can be drawn in a app.
Image is converted to gray level using glcm , cv2.colour , RGB algebra.
Fast and accurate results with ease from home.
