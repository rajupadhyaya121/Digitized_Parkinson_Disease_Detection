# Digitized_Parkinson_Disease_Detection
This is a project based on detecting Parkinson disease using digitized spiral images using ML and Deep Learning using TensorFlow, Keras, Streamlit, OpenCV . The models used are Random Forest, Knn, Logistic Regression and CNN-2D .
Importance- Regular visit to doctor necessary but not possible .Some innovation needed in home check
Brain MRI are expensive and uncomfortable.
Easily accessible with one digitized tab where spiral drawings can be drawn in a app.
Image is converted to gray level using glcm , cv2.colour , RGB algebra
Fast and accurate results with ease from home.
